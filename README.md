# This is an effort to learn more about HTTP by practical means
# 
# Basically, I've just jumped in and tried to make one from scratch with no guidance
# 
# I then realised I was lost and grabbed a load of research, dumping it in "inf"
# 
# At some point (when I return to this project) I will read this shizzle and get some proper coding done
# 
# This is currently kinda stagnant
